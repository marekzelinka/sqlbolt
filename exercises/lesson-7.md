# Lesson 7: OUTER JOINs

In this exercise, you are going to be working with a new table which stores fictional data about **Employees** in the film studio and their assigned office **Buildings**. Some of the buildings are new, so they don't have any employees in them yet, but we need to find some information about them regardless.

Since our browser SQL database is somewhat limited, only the **LEFT JOIN** is supported in the exercise below.
