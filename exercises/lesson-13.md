# SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows

In this exercise, we are going to play studio executive and add a few movies to the Movies to our portfolio. In this table, the Id is an auto-incrementing integer, so you can try inserting a row with only the other columns defined.

Since the following lessons will modify the database, you'll have to manually run each query once they are ready to go.
