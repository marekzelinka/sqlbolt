# SQL Lesson 15: Deleting rows

The database needs to be cleaned up a little bit, so try and delete a few rows in the tasks below.

> Like the **UPDATE** statement from last lesson, it's recommended that you run the constraint in a **SELECT** query first to ensure that you are removing the right rows. Without a proper backup or test database, it is downright easy to irrevocably remove data, so always read your **DELETE** statements twice and execute once.
